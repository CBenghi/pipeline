
EXRLoader Example

This example shows how to write a Texture loader plugin to load .EXR texture
files using the OpenEXR ( www.openexr.com ) library. OpenEXR is a high-dynamic
range (HDR) image file format developed by Industrial Light & Magic. 

After compiling this project, the resulting EXRLoader.nxm and the needed
OpenEXR(64) DLL files will be automatically copied to the right output
directory $(NVSGSDKHOME)\bin\<ARCH>\win\<CRT>\$(ConfigurationName), with 
<ARCH> either x86 or amd64, and <CRT> the Visual Studio version the project
was compiled with.
